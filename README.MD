## What & how is used to build this app?

### Hight level architecture

#### Backend

- Read the API Docs, get the endpoints needed & how to use the recommended library (**cfb.js**) that supports JavaScript.
- Install the packages needed.
- Create folders & files for start point (index.js), routes (teamRoutes.js), controllers (teamControllers.js) and the middleware needed & fetch the data, propagate it & return it.

#### Frontend

- Scaffold a React app using npx create-react-app tool.
- Cleanup the react app files & update the title in the html header.
- Structure the folders in **src** folder as follows:

  - **assets**: contains media files like images.
  - **components**: contains reusable components.
  - **context**: contains the state management files.
  - **pages**: contains full pages files that are each is been displayed according to a specific route.
  - **util**: contains general hooks & functions that could be used all over the app.
